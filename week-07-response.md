The problems that James Birdle brings up concerning algorithims and how media outlets manipulate audiences are valid.
I also agree with Birdle that these are in fact problems that are increasing today, that doesn't only target children but everyone as a whole. 
I agree that using bots to create account to generate revenue and possibly exposing kids to traumatic things is a problem and should be get ridden of.
However when facing realtiy, these issues should've been solved, I know that Facebok gotten in trouble a few years back for something similiar with saving users data and selling it to thrid parties. 
This stuff should've laid out a clear line back then for all types of media, if it didn't then I do not see it being solved in teh future and this will continue to be a problem.
He also talks about the use of internet back in the day compared to today and how it affected him and who he was as a person. 
I can say the same for myself on how much the itnernet as impacted me as a person. 

In the future when I am a parent I may have very different feelings just as Birdle and other concerned parents have for their children. 
It is scary to think that we are all part of the algorithim that will continue to have our information and try to advertise to us thing we may or may not want no matter what.
The fact that others make profit off of this and that there hasn't been more exposure to others out there who need to know is concerning. 
I know there is a woman named Carole Cadwallader who tried to expose the harm Facebook poses and other media outlets and how they try to intimidate her with lawsuits and threats. 
Another person who writes about these issues and states this things is Van Dijck, who also explains how Facebook has manipulated terms such as friend, like, dharing, and privacy.
Those terms were changed to benefit Facebook and other big coporations, and allow them to do things that are wrong and avoid legal action against them.
