When it comes to advertising, I believe myself and others are targeted in various ways.
O'Neil point out several methods in which how people are targeted.
One way O'Neil explained was through predatory ads in which it targets people's weaknesses "pain point", no matter what it may be, from depression to money spending habits.
With these predatory ads it targets large groups of people in a short amount of time through surveys, questionaires, and other variety of tests and data that is collected by social media.
Thus in turn, allows them to target the audiences they are trying to reach, no matter how sinnister they need to be.

When O'Neil talks about College Board, I was forced to use this when I was in high school and I did get targeted by many for profit schools, to this day I still recieve some mail advertisement to enroll to their universities. 
I have also been exposed to A/B testing, I always recieve credit card offers due to my credit score being a 746, especially new credit card offers from my bank Chase. 
I have also been guilty for filling out surveys on various social media sites as well from stores I make purchases from, which leads me to reciving more mail or ads on my feed targeting me!
I feel like some of these ad methods would be useful in keeping because some will help people out while I believe others will abuse it.
For example maybe looking for a new internet provider online, may provide you with a better service provider with a better price or one that is more reliable! 
I feel it just depends who is using these methods and who they are targeting. 
I feel that if we lose these ad methods people may complain if they can't find what they are looking for, many ads can provide reccomendations and lead people to sites in which they can probably find what they are looking for at a faster rate. 
I also feel that it should be something we are all used to and having it removed may feel weird to many sites we use daily.
