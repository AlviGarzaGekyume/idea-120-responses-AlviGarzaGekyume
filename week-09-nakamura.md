Nakamura's citation of Lev Manovich's sayiing "interactive media asks us to identify with someone else's mental structure", to me is believed to be understood as fallowing someones pre-programmed thought/identification.
What I mean by this is whenever someone engages on the interent with someones post or application on any social media, you are put into someones mental structure.
For example in the book Nakamura gives an example of someone following a hyperlink on a sentence leads us to an obkectively existing association. 
With this being said, whenever we interact with something we are already pre-programmed to believe what that person believes in whatever they write and what they attach to it. 
Thus we follow into their already objective association to whatever thought or topic they may be commenting or interacting with. 

When it comes to tools I use such as TikTok and google, we follow the developers mental structure and their own identities in various ways. 
First I want to start off with TikTok since I use that interactive media a lot, usually videos range from a few seconds to 3 minutes max, in which many times people have to create mutiple parts for videos if their videos are longer than three minutes.
That fact the developer has limited this media to creating only videos to get your point across shows that they wanted their media to be interactive amongst the users. 
It also shows how the conent that comes up is going to relate to videos you like or users you follow which programs you to further try out thier content "the bots reccomendations".
When looking at it like this, it seems sinister and controlling, it's very scary to think about. 
On the other hand it shows that maybe the developer only enjoyed and could learn through media in which people need to interact with more in order to learn or enjoy entertainment. 
Hence, why TikTok is so popular because it requires people to be interactive with challenges and a variety of other content there is.
