What unique expereinces do games give people, the creators and the people who play the games?
What can be considered a game?
Is there any limitations on what games can be or what they can show/depict? 


While the assignment requires that I answer one of the questions that I had thought of about the reading, I will try to answer all because these are genuine questions I have.
I would like to start off with my question of what can be considered a game.
In the reading the author referes to a variety of games from different cultures as well as games that existed in the past long ago, from chess, the viking board game, hide and seek, as well as tag.
The reading also defines a game as an experience created by rules, and this definition was meant to include all games in a broad way, since we have a variety of gmaes that are physical and digital.
This definition makes sense to me because there is many times where people ask what are my hobbies and I always say gaming is one of mine, some people think I play board/card games while others assume video games and vice versa. 
However, I play all sorts of games digital and physical, I would say my favorite board game is War on Terror! 

The second questions I wanted to answer is what experiences do games give players and the creators.
With every game there is a different experience to be had, the author discucsses the difference in strategic war thought Vikinings and European Kings had when playing their given games.
Then the Gang Rape game that was designed to inform and educate people abount gang rape, it is a game desgined to educated but also make people feel uneasy about the situation and it was not meant to be played for fun or fantasize experiences.
Some games let people express their creativity without barriers or even build thier own cities and govern them!
Some games are just first-person shooters and made to be won, others people try to speed run or even live a fantasy life in, in most cases in RPG games. 
It is also intereesting to see how character customization and sotry telling is different from American games to Japanese games, such as the fact American games allow more individualality while Japane has a more you are given this role and nothig more.
The games are also designed to represent the creators values, which is something I never thought about before.

For my last question sadly, the neither of the chapters talked about it, however this question had rose after reading the section about the game of Gang Rape, since I never heard of the game and in my head that game would be very graphic.
I know there is a rating system for games but I don't know much about it other than seeing it just like movie ratings being PG or rated R. 
So upon further reasearch online, I discovered that the name of the system to rate games is called Entertainment Software Rating baord and has 5 typical ratings and 2 undecided ratings.
The ratings are as follows, E for Everyone, E for Everyone 10+, T for Teen, M for Mature 17+, A for Adults Only 18+, then the two undecided ratings when games are pending a rating, RP for Rating Pending and RP fo Rate Pending Likely Mature 17+.
I was mostly familiar with T and M ratings since I have always played shooters from a young age, I never knew there was a rating above M, which was interesting to learn and I think that maybe that Gang Rape game may fall into lines with that rating or may have a rating of its own, since I have never even played an A rated game.
This now leaves me wondering if in the future may we see more A rated games, since I believe M rated games are more prevalnet in todays society.
