# **Conemporary Tools Used to Make** ***Gesamtkunstwerk*** **Art**

For starters I believe it would best to define the term Gesamtkunstwerk. 
Gesamtkunstwerk means a total work of art, in mnay cases which can be comprehended and applied in many different ways to each individual. 
With that in mind, there is a wide variety of contemporrary tools that can be used to create such art that can be digital or physical.
Many current day arts use many elements used in the past to create such art for people today, weather it may be through music, live performance, cinema and many other ways. 
One play that I was fortunate to expereince in my high school AP class was a play about the Tiananmen Square, which used many elements from sound, smell, music, lighting, and many other techniques.
These techniques used allowed for me and others in the audience to be drawn in to what was happening and give a live recreation of what occured in Tiananmen Square in 1989. 

There is many Electro Dance Music "EDM" festivals I have attended in which they use a variety of techniques to captivate the audience. 
This can be through the utilization of lazers, digital images/videos, smoke, strobe lights, fireworks, stage flame throwers, as well as many other devices to create an atmosphere in which fans can enjoy the music.
When going through Net Art Anthology the pieces of art that stood out most to me were the Simple Net Art Diagram, Youth Mode: A Report On Freedom, and Ethira. 
I believe each of those art works can be considered as Gesamtkunstwerk. 
Each of those pieces of art try to captivate their auidences in different ways, some may not have a specific audience, it could just be people who happen to come about it and try to get a feel for it.
Each use a variety of digital images to lead the viewers through a vision in the lens of the creator/artist.
