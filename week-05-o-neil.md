# **Example of WMD**

Before I can give an example of what ***Weapon of Math Destruction*** (**WMD**) is, I would first need to define that term.
A ***WMD*** is a model coded or not, in which when it is giving harmful or false verdicts, that are beyond dispute/appeal. 
Typically punish the poor and oppressed, while benefiting the rich. 
There were many examples of WMDs given in O'Neils book, ranging from rating teachers performances to the use of apps to give law enfrocement more precise beats that were calculated to have the most crime, and amongst other models of WMDs.
Some of these may have some sort of benefits such as the school rating system which increased the qualtiy education and college expereinces for students, some schools did shady things in order to boost those scores as well.


However besides these quick examples from the book, I'll try to give an exmple that I see in the world today in society. 
In many poorer sides of cities/towns, law enforcement gives incresingly more tickets to those who reside in those areas.
In many cases they tickets are for non-serious violations, which later builds up due to people not being able to afford the payments or receive more tickets which sends them down a spiral.
When these ticekts add up for an individual from a low socioeconomic background, they lose their means to transportation, which mean losing their job and building debt of traffic tickets.
Which continues to punish the individual even when they can't afford to pay of the ticket which incurs interests.
This lead many to people to have thier cars towed or face prison time, some opt for brankruptcy. 


This system of meeting a demand for tickets, negatively impacts the minorities in low socioeconomic backrgrounds. 
This is one of the sources of income for cities and towns, and doing a quick google search can expose many corrupt departments who make a lot of money from these traffic tickets.
On the other hand whites and other high income communities don't suffer these same circumstances. 
This is practiced by many police deparments across the country, which increases the salary for some police officers and in other cases it provides revenue for the cities.
The model of punishing those from low incomes areas has been a thing done for hundreds of years.
