After playing a variety of the twine games and seeing the various ways I can tackle this project, I believe I will settle with maybe a medieval story/game. 
I probably will have the start up explain something about waking in a dungeon, or being put into a dungeon. 
The player will then explore the dungeon with a variety of options from fighting and scavenging.
With each death the player loses some precious items, and while exploring will allow the player to have a chance to find other characters in the game that can help them clear and explore the dungeon.
Some characters encountered can have special perks, maybe like preventing the loss of items on death, or maybe healing, boost to damage for the party (player and other characters with them).
Then probably have some erie music in the background playing as well, and maybe like a halo sound when finding a good item/weapon.
Maybe add a few bosses like maybe a troll/dragon etc, depending how far the player gets into the dungeon.
