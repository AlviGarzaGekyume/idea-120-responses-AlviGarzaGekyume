# **Reading an Image Through Different Mediums**

![This is an Activision Click-bait image](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0e/78/98/0e7898359fd7b8ad882540313591061f.jpg)

This image is a click-bait image for a YouTube channel concnering a leak for a future game and some concerning news for a video game company.
Normally on YouTube people would see this as click-bait mostly for the fact that when it comes to news dropping on pre-orders it doesn't really have that much information about that game, in this case it would be the new GrandTheftAuto(GTA) game.
The image concerning GTA would increase views on the video, which its main purpose would be concerning Activision. 
The problem with Activision would be about it going bankrupt or something game breaking within one of its Call of Duty games.
This is extremely common within the gaming community, when viewing the click-bait image.
However, if an image similar to this was displayed on a Live News TV Medium, it would be viewed in an entirely different way.

This image being viewed on Live News on TV would be read very differently.
The image appearing on the news would pose concerns for those who are investing in Activision or those supporting Activision in some way.
It can lead people to thinking lawsuits, mistreatment of workers (men and women), or even some sort of toxic work environment towards women. 
When it comes understanding an image, Barthes believed there to be 3 messages within an image. 
These 3 messages are; 1. Linguistic Message, 2. Coded Iconic Message, 3. Non-coded Iconic Message. 
In this case the linguistic message would be concerning activists/protest.
The coded iconic image would be the knowdledge of the type of toxic work enviornments gaming companies can be, especially towards the mistreatment of female workers.
The non-coded iconic image would just be seeing the image as a protest for female workers within Activison Blizzard, wanting proper and equal work enviornment.
