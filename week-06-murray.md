In Murray's book, the predictions made were very close to where things are today with technology. 
There has been quite a few shows and apps that have drastically changed in how we interact with gaming, the internet, and tv. 
I think Murray's predictions were close to being flawless, and near successful. 
Murray brought up many things with the update section of the chaper in which it is more deeply explained what people experience with the technology and internet today.
For an example when Murray brings up interactions with TV shows, Bandersnatch was one that provided a whole new way of viewing/interacting with a TV show/ movie.
Murray also brings up the various apps that contend with each other to provide the newest way to interact with, as the new main living room appliance.
When Murray explained how some people interact differently with movies once they play a game that took place in the same time era as the movie, but provided a whole new point of view. 
Murray referred to star wars and his own son play the game and has a different reaction when rewatching the movie. 
Murray also brought up TellTale games which is a game company that develops games that require the user to make different decisions that affect the story, and you have to live with the consequences. 
We also have VR now as well in which we can interact with games, movies, and apps in new ways that were never possible with before. 
We still have cable but a lot of people stick to the wifi and use apps such as Netflix, HBO GO, and many others to watch tv/movies. 
Also, Murrays prediction still stands strong when it comes to actors and viewers of the TV show the Mandalorian. 
Using green screens are becoming a thing of the past and that used to make the actors try to picture the world they would be in and use a lot of money to produce movies/shows.
Now a big show aka The Mandolorian, the environments are produced with game engines such as the Unreal engine, which has made many good very realistic looking games. 
The environment can be chnaged with a button and now actors can be more in-tune when acting, since they can see the environment they are in, however there is some limitations of using digital screens.
Such as any action scenes may require some green screens to prevent breaking any digital equipment.
