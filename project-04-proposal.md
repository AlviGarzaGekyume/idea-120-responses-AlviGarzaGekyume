As of right now going through all the different examples of websites listed, I really liked how David Brauns was.
I want to format my portfolio to inlcude all the projects on one page with some sub headings on side with contact information and my name. 
I would also like to include a picture of my past projects with a small description of what I did. 
I would also like my colors to vary with a white background and black/greyish text color, I want to keep it simple and nothing too fancy. 
For my first project I would like to post a picture of the top of the website then include a direct link to the website. 
As for my second project maybe I can post a screenshot of the background in action and maybe post a video of the beckground. 
For my last project I might do a screenshot of the title screen then a link to the game!
As for my other thing to include from one of my personal projects from my other classes may be some photography photos I have taken!
