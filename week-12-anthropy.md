Before I can talk about the questions concerning this assingment such as how accessibility in gaming and coding can help improve video games, we need to look at some problems.
In the reading it was discussed that a lot of content within the gaming industry is very repetitive with either just shooting or games having the same mechanics with nothing new being added to the game and developers just hooping that their sales will increase.
This was also complaints about queer woman not being represented enough in video games and if there was any homosexual content in a game, relating to two men engaing in sexual activity, it is done from a white males perspecitve that is straight. 
These are only a few problems that are brought up which some I agree with while with others I don't.
I personally have played hundreds of games from RPGs to FPS, and while I do agree that with a lot of main games, there isn't much content tailored towards the LGBT community and women, this is because gaming has always been a target for the male audiences, also a majority of gamers are not part of the LGBT community in which I believe this is why bigger developers don't really tailor a game to the LGBT community because that is not their audience.
With that being said, I guess I can now focus on the questions at hand.

When it comes to increasing accessibility and coding for video games can very much provide incredible improvements towards improving games and their content.
As stated before I am a big gamer and have gamed my whole life from using sega and old school gameboys to current generations of xbox and the nintendo switch. 
Through these games systems some common big game titles for nintendo may be pokemon and for xbox it may be halo and gears of war. 
Throughout the years many of these games kept the same base game mechanics such as catching pokemon and exploring in pokemon games, over the years they may add new story lines and new pokemon but in general you'll hust be repeating what you have done in previous pokemon games.
You start off with a low level pokemon and work your way to defeating gym bosses to get badges and fight some bad factions within the games, over the years customization with characters and improving graphics may be the main differences amongst the games as well as having a new story.

On the other hand you also have the games Halo and Gears of War for xbox, in which just like the game pokemon have had numerous continuations to the games.
With each game their is either a new story or a continuation of the previous games story.
For example Gears of War 1-3 were about Marucs Fenix which is the main protagonist, to the newer Gears 4 & 5 focus more on Mercus Fenix's son and his female friend. 
The games increase graphics change the story of who the protagonist is and create new enemies to worry about, with the base function of hte game of being a gorey shooter staying the same with keep some of the same guns and adding a few new ones and a variety of customization and new executions.
Same thing can be said with Halo which has plenty of games, some are a continuation of the man game while some of the side ones telling different stories and giving new insights into the games universe.
My favorites being Halo Reach, Halo Odst, and Halo Wars.
This is due to the fact Halo Reach you play as a spartan (super soldier), that feels more human like with emotions and has a more sad story to it, it causes you to get attached to other characters real quick.
Halo odst puts you into the perspective of a normal human during this alien war, which gives you the feeling of not being super strong like a spartan and the game has a more somber lone wolf tone to it since you get separated from your team and you have to find them alone while fighting large groups of aliens.
Then halo wars puts you into a strategic command position where you make troops and bases and requires stratedgy to beat, which is also complex yet rewarding to play and is different form the games main FPS focus.

Increasing the general populations access to tools to design games and coding can provide feedback from everyday gamers.
This can be feedback and ideas given from under-represented fans/gamers, which can provide more satisfaction to the bigger population of gamers.
Also, maybe even just including more minorities to voice characters can even be a game changer, no pun intended, but what I mean by this is that main game studios usually use repretitive voice liners which kinda ruins the expereince in games if you already heard their voices in another main game not related to the one you are playing.
If people have access to gaming tools and coding then there can also be more successful indie games that can flourish such as Minecraft, which started with one man working on the game to develop such a wonderful peice of art which I still play to this day.
It also can provide better content for games reciving outside help from main gaming industries or it can break the main game industry that is male dominated accoridng to the reading, this is an alternative way gaming can break its norms.
I feel like if the skills are more easily attainable, we can see more successful games being created that target a variety audiences and won't leave anyone left out and who knows it may even change the hearts of the main indsutry game studios.
